# Bollinger Band - Genetic Algorithm Trading
This project was an example project to learn Matlab's Genetic Algorithm tool-suite.

## Over All Objective
[1] Acquire Daily Trade information
[2] Create Bollinger Band Trading signals based on variable moving average period and variable deviation band size
[3] Trade off these triggers for a given period and return a Sharpe information
[4] Run above strategy through Matlab Genetic Algorithm to search for optimal variable moving average period and variable deviation band size to maximize Sharpe Ratio
